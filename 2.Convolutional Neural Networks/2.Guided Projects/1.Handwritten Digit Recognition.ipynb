The dataset was constructed from a number of scanned document datasets available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is where the name for the dataset comes from, as the Modified NIST or MNIST dataset.\n",

This makes it an excellent dataset for evaluating models, allowing the developer to focus on the machine learning with minimal data cleaning or preparation required. Each image is a 28 x 28-pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard split of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model, and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it.\n",

Results are reported using prediction error, which is nothing more than the inverted classification accuracy. Excellent results achieve a prediction error of less than 1%. A state-of-the-art prediction error of approximately 0.2% can be achieved with large Convolutional Neural Networks.
