These benefit from making large changes at the beginning of the training procedure when larger learning rate values are used and decreasing the learning rate such that a lower rate and therefore smaller training updates are made to weights later in the training procedure. This has the effect of quickly learning good weights early and fine-tuning them later. Two popular and easy to use learning rate schedules are as follows:\n",

The fixed ten epochs of training would use a value of 0.1, in the next ten epochs, a learning rate of 0.05 would be used, and so on.
