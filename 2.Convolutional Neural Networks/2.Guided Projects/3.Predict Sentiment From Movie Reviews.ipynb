This is a technique where words are encoded as real-valued vectors in a high dimensional space, where the similarity between words in terms of meaning translates to closeness in the vector space. Discrete words are mapped to vectors of continuous numbers. This is useful when working with natural language problems with neural networks as we require numbers as input values.\n",

The layer takes arguments that define the mapping, including the maximum number of expected words, also called the vocabulary size (e.g., the largest integer value that will be seen as an input). The layer also allows you to specify the dimensionality for each word vector, called the output dimension.\n",

    "We want to use a word embedding representation for the IMDB dataset. Let's say that we are only interested in the first 5,000 most used words in the dataset. Therefore our vocabulary size will be 5,000. We can choose to use a 32-dimensional vector to represent each word. Finally, we may choose to cap the maximum review length at 500 words, truncating reviews longer than that and padding reviews shorter than that with 0 values.
