    "Given a dataset of grayscale images with the standardized size of 32 x 32 pixels each, a traditional feedforward neural network would require 1,024 input weights (plus one bias). This is fair enough, but the flattening of the image matrix of pixels to a long vector of pixel values loses all of the image's spatial structure. Unless all of the images are perfectly resized, the neural network will have great difficulty with the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Neural Networks expect and preserve the spatial relationship between pixels by learning internal feature representations using small squares of input data. Features are learned and used across the whole image, allowing for the objects in the images to be shifted or translated in the scene and still detectable by the network. This is why the network is so useful for object recognition in photographs, picking out digits, faces, objects, and so on with varying orientations. In summary, below are some of the benefits of using convolutional neural networks:\n",

If the size of the previous layer is not cleanly divisible by the size of the filter's receptive field and the stride's size, it is possible for the receptive field to attempt to read off the input's edge feature map. In this case, techniques like zero padding can be used to invent mock inputs with zero values for the receptive field to read."

    "* **Input Receptive Field Dimensions**: The default is 2D for images, but it could be 1D, such as for words in a sentence or 3D for a video that adds a time dimension.\n",
    "* **Receptive Field Size**: The patch should be as small as possible but large enough to see the input data features. It is common to use 3 x 3 on small images and 5 x 5 or 7 x 7 and larger image sizes.\n",
    "* **Stride Width**: Use the default stride of 1. It is easy to understand, and you don't need padding to handle the receptive field falling off the edge of your images. This could be increased to 2 or larger for larger images.\n",
    "* **Number of Filters**: Filters are the feature detectors. Fewer filters are generally used at the input layer, and increasingly more filters are used at deeper layers.\n",
    "* **Padding**: Set to zero and called zero padding when reading non-input data. This is useful when you cannot or do not want to standardize input image sizes or when you want to use receptive field and stride sizes that do not neatly divide up the input image size.\n",
    "* **Pooling**: Pooling is a destructive or generalization process to reduce overfitting. Receptive field size is almost always set to 2 x 2 with a stride of 2 to discard 75% of the activations from the previous layer's output.\n",
    "* **Data Preparation**: Consider standardizing input data, both the dimensions of the images and pixel values.\n",
    "* **Pattern Architecture**: It is common to pattern the layers in your network architecture. This might be one, two, or some number of convolutional layers followed by a pooling layer. This structure can then be repeated one or more times. Finally, fully connected layers are often only used at the output end and maybe stacked one, two, or deeper. \n",
