    "Training a neural network or a large deep learning model is a difficult optimization task. The classical algorithm to train neural networks is called stochastic gradient descent. It has been well established that you can achieve increased performance and faster training on some problems using a learning rate during training. In this lesson, you will discover how you can use different learning rate schedules for your neural network models in Python using the Keras deep learning library.

    "Adapting the learning rate for your stochastic gradient descent optimization procedure can increase performance and reduce training time. Sometimes this is called learning rate annealing or adaptive learning rates. Here we will call this approach a learning rate schedule, where the default schedule is to use a constant learning rate to update network weights for each training epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most straightforward and perhaps most used adaptation of learning rates during training are techniques that reduce the learning rate over time. These benefit from making large changes at the beginning of the training procedure when larger learning rate values are used and decreasing the learning rate such that a lower rate and therefore smaller training updates are made to weights later in the training procedure. This has the effect of quickly learning good weights early and fine-tuning them later. Two popular and easy to use learning rate schedules are as follows:\n",

    "The example below demonstrates using the time-based learning rate adaptation schedule in Keras. A small neural network model is constructed with a single hidden layer with 34 neurons and using the rectifier activation function. The output layer has a single neuron and uses the sigmoid activation function to output probability-like values. The learning rate for stochastic gradient descent has been set to a higher value of 0.1. The model is trained for 50 epochs, and the decay argument has been set to 0.002, calculated as $\\frac{0.1}{50}$.\n",

    "Another popular learning rate schedule used with deep learning models is to drop the learning rate at specific times during training systematically. Often this method is implemented by dropping the learning rate by half every fixed number of epochs. For example, we may have an initial learning rate of 0.1 and drop it by a factor of 0.5 every ten epochs. The fixed ten epochs of training would use a value of 0.1, in the next ten epochs, a learning rate of 0.05 would be used, and so on. If we plot out the learning rates for this example out to 100 epochs, you get the graph below-showing learning rate (y-axis) versus epoch (x-axis).\n",

    "We can implement this in Keras using the `LearningRateScheduler` callback when fitting the model. The `LearningRateScheduler` callback allows us to define a function to call that takes the epoch number as an argument and returns the learning rate to use in stochastic gradient descent. When used, the learning rate specified by stochastic gradient descent is ignored. In the code below, we use the same example as a single hidden layer network on the Ionosphere dataset. A new `step_decay()` function is defined that implements the equation:\n",

    "* **Use a large momentum**: Using a larger momentum value will help the optimization algorithm continue to make updates in the right direction when your learning rate shrinks to small values.\n",
    "* **Experiment with schedules**: It will not be clear which learning rate schedule to use, so try a few with different configuration options and see what works best on your problem. Also, try schedules that change exponentially and even schedules that respond to your model's accuracy on the training or test datasets."
